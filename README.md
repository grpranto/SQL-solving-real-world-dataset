<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project
This project was a part the course [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) where my tasks were to solve a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. My job was to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district.

Datasets used: 
* [Chicago Census Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork22-2023-01-01)
* [Chicago Public Schools](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork22-2023-01-01)
* [Chicago Crimes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork22-2023-01-01)

Executed the appropriate SQL queries to answer each of the following problems:
* Problem 1: Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.
* Problem 2: List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.
* Problem 3: List all case numbers for crimes involving minors?
* Problem 4: List all kidnapping crimes involving a child?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)
* Problem 5: What kind of crimes were recorded at schools?
* Problem 6: List the average safety score for all types of schools.
* Problem 7: List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line.
* Problem 8: Which community area(number) is most crime prone?
* Problem 9: Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index.
* Problem 10: Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?
